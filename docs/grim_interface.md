# Grim-terface v2.9 Spellbook

A quick-reference guide to the "Grim-terface" hotkeys and capabilities described in the Grimoire spellbook (Readme + PatchNotes v2.8). Use it as a sidecar cheat sheet while coding or debugging.

**Hotkey tips**
- Hotkeys are always available and can be chained (for example, hit `S` to explain, then `D` to iterate on the result).
- Mix quick actions with debug or export keys as needed—no special mode switching is required.

## Core functions
- Full-stack AI coding assistant for generating apps, games, websites, and scripts from natural language prompts.
- Image-to-code conversion that can translate sketches or UI captures into runnable sites.
- Auto deployers for instant Netlify or Replit publishing.
- Prompt-gramming tutorial featuring 75 lessons (Parts 1–9 plus interludes).
- Code debug mode with line prints, bounding boxes, and stack traces.
- Search assistant that drafts Google / Stack Overflow / Phind queries.
- Export suite for zipping, deploying, or tweeting the final project.
